Today, when I was at the grocery store picking up a few things, I noticed they had something called Dubai chocolate. Now you might be wondering, “What is Dubai chocolate?” Well, it’s a chocolate filled with kunafa and pistachio cream – something that’s recently become a huge trend on social media. So when I saw it at my local store, I felt like I just had to try it.

Total price: 79.90 SEK. An extremely high price for a piece of chocolate, but with a price like that, it has to be something special, right? So I sat down on a bench outside the store, opened the little chocolate box, and shared it with a friend. We both pop the chocolate in our mouths – and are instantly disappointed. It basically just tasted like chocolate and sugar. That’s it.

In all the videos online, people are way too excited about it. Words like “heavenly” and “amazing” are thrown around constantly. But why? There’s nothing heavenly or amazing about an overly sweet chocolate that costs almost 80 SEK. And believe it or not – that’s considered cheap for this type of chocolate. It usually sells for up to 200 SEK.

But hey, of course people can buy, eat, and enjoy whatever they want. Still, buying something just because it went viral online feels a bit unnecessary. The whole thing gives me serious Prime vibes – ridiculously expensive, insanely hyped, and then the price drops hard once it gets enough attention to actually sell.

That was my rant for today. Thanks and goodbye! :)
